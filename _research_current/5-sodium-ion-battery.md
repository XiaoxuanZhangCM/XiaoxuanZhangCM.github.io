Sodium-ion batteries could provide a low-cost solution for large-scale energy storage. To use the layered intercalation compounds as electrodes for sodium-ion batteries with enhanced mechanical stability and electrochemical cyclability, we need to better understand the structural phase transitions involving stacking sequence changes of the layers. In this work, we aim to develop a computational model for such purpose.
