Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, also called receptor-mediated endocytosis, is a process by which cells absorb substances (sometimes viruses) by the inward budding of the plasma membrane. Understanding the mechanics involved in this process could offer important insights for disease diagnosis, drug delivery, targeted therapy, etc. In this work, we aim to study mechanics and morphology changes of membranes when interacting with different particles by using a three-dimensional membrane computational framework.
