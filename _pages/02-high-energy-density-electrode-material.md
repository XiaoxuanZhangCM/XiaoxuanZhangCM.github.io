Silicon is considered as a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries. Despite the great attention on Si anode materials, a consistent description of the diffusion and reaction mechanism at the reaction front of crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, and delithiated amorphous silicon has not yet been proposed. To better understand those mechanisms, a new reaction-controlled diffusion formulation is proposed. The new formulation makes use of the bond-breaking energy barrier E0 as the key physical quantity. With the consideration of different values of E0, the two-phase diffusion during initial lithiation of both crystalline Si and amorphous Si can be well represented with an evident reaction front. In addition, by varying E0, the one phase lithiation of amorphous Si, obtained after the delithiation process, can be captured with the new formulation. The effect of deformation, hydrostatic pressure at the reaction front, and Li concentration level on the reaction front velocity is taken into account in the proposed model. 

As the large volume change during (de)lithiation processes causes fracture of Si electrodes, Siâ€™s practical application in lithium-ion batteries is limited. We also formulate a variational-based fully chemo-mechanical coupled computational framework to study diffusion induced large plastic deformation and phase field fracture in Si electrodes. Into this framework we incorporate the reaction-controlled diffusion model to predict two-phase lithiation for amorphous Si (a-Si) and crystalline Si (c-Si) as well as diffusion induced anisotropic deformation for c-Si. The variational formulation suggests to consider the deformation field, the chemical potential, and the damage field as primary unknowns. The concentration field is considered as a local variable and is recovered from the chemical potential on the element level. We carry out several numerical simulations to show the performance of our computational model and point out the significance of accurately accounting for the presence of the reaction front when modeling diffusion induced fracture problems for both a-Si and c-Si electrodes. In addition, we investigate how the fracture energy release rate, electrode geometry, and geometrical constraints affect the fracture behavior of Si electrodes.
