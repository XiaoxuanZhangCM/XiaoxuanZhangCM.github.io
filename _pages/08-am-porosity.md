Compared to conventional metal fabrication processes, additive manufacturing (AM) offers advantages in several aspects, such as handling complex geometries, rapid prototyping, reduced material wastes, etc. However, parts made by AM tend to have higher variation in their mechanical properties due to multiple factors, such as porosity, residual stresses, surface roughness, etc. In this work, we use data-driven methods to model the crack initiation in AM components due to heterogamous porosity distribution.
