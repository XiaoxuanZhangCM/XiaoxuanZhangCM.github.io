My research centers on developing novel theories, methods, and tools to advance scientific computing. I am particularly interested in developing physics-based models and scientific machine learning methods (SciML) to address generalized computational challenges and application-specific challenges for computational discovery, material optimization, and smart manufacturing. 

<h2>Physics-based models </h2>
<h3>Generalized </h3>
* [Fracture modeling](fracture-modeling)

<h3>Application-specific </h3>
* [Si electrode material](high-energy-density-electrode-material)
* [Lithium-ion batteries](mechanics-in-lithium-ion-batteriesl)
* [Biomembrane mechanics](biological-membrane-mechanics)

[Solid-state lithium-ion batteries modeling](ssb)


<h2>SciML</h2>
<h3>Generalized </h3>
* [Data-driven homogenization](data-driven-homogenization)
* [Machine learning for PDE solutions](nn-based-pde-solver)

<h3>Application-specific </h3>
* [Data-driven modeling of crack initiation in 3D printed metal parts](am-porosity)
