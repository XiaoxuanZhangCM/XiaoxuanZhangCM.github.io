My research centers on developing novel theories, methods, and tools to advance scientific computing. I am particularly interested in developing physics-based models and scientific machine learning (SciML) methods to address generalized computational challenges and application-specific challenges for computational discovery, material optimization, and smart manufacturing. I work on applications such as rechargeable batteries (Bat), biological materials (Bio), and additive manufacturing (AM).

<b>Physics-based models </b>
* [Fracture modeling](fracture-modeling)

<b>SciML methods</b>
* [Data-driven homogenization](data-driven-homogenization)
* [Machine learning for PDE solutions](nn-based-pde-solver)

<b>Applications </b>
* [(Bat) Silicon electrode material](high-energy-density-electrode-material)
* [(Bat) Lithium-ion batteries](mechanics-in-lithium-ion-batteriesl)
* [(Bat) Solid-state batteries](ssb)
* [(Bio) Biomembrane mechanics](biological-membrane-mechanics)
* [(AM) Crack initiation in 3D printed metal parts](am-porosity)
