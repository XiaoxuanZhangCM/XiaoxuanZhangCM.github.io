<p>My research centers on developing novel theories, methods, and tools to advance scientific computing. I am particularly interested in developing physics-based models and scientific machine learning (SciML) methods to address generalized computational challenges and application-specific challenges for computational discovery, material optimization, and smart manufacturing. I work on applications such as rechargeable batteries (Bat), biological materials (Bio), and additive manufacturing (AM).</p>
