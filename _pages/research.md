My research centers on developing novel theories, methods, and tools to advance scientific computing. I am particularly interested in developing physics-based models and scientific machine learning methods (SciML) to address generalized computational challenges and application-specific challenges for computational discovery, material optimization, and smart manufacturing. 

<h3>Physics-based models </h3>
* Generalized
  * [Fracture modeling](fracture-modeling)
* Application-specific
  * [Si electrode material](high-energy-density-electrode-material)
  * [Lithium-ion batteries](mechanics-in-lithium-ion-batteriesl)
  * [Solid-state batteries](ssb)
  * [Biomembrane mechanics](biological-membrane-mechanics)

<h3>SciML</h3>
* Generalized
  * [Data-driven homogenization](data-driven-homogenization)
  * [Machine learning for PDE solutions](nn-based-pde-solver)
* Application-specific
  * [Data-driven modeling of crack initiation in 3D printed metal parts](am-porosity)
