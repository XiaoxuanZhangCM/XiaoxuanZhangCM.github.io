My research centers on developing novel theories, methods, and tools to advance scientific computing. I am particularly interested in developing physics-based models and scientific machine learning (SciML) methods to address generalized computational challenges and application-specific challenges for computational discovery, material optimization, and smart manufacturing. 

<h5>Physics-based models </h5>
* [Fracture modeling](fracture-modeling)

<h5>SciML methods</h5>
* [Data-driven homogenization](data-driven-homogenization)
* [Machine learning for PDE solutions](nn-based-pde-solver)

<h5>Applications </h5>
* [(BATT) Si electrode material](high-energy-density-electrode-material)
* [(BATT) Lithium-ion batteries](mechanics-in-lithium-ion-batteriesl)
* [(BATT) Solid-state batteries](ssb)
* [(BIO) Biomembrane mechanics](biological-membrane-mechanics)
* [(AM) Data-driven modeling of crack initiation in 3D printed metal parts](am-porosity)
