Welcome to my website! I am Xiaoxuan, a postdoctoral research fellow in [the Computational Physics Group](http://www.umich.edu/~compphys/index.html) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford University in January 2018. My research interest lies in developing accurate, robust, and efficient multiphysics, multiscale, and data-driven computational models. I apply these models to investigate a range of physical problems including three-dimensional non-planar fracture propagation, diffusion and reaction induced large deformation in high-energy density electrode materials, the coupling between mechanics and the electrochemical process in lithium-ion batteries, mechanochemical spinodal decomposition in multi-component crystallines, biological membrane mechanics, and diffusion-induced misfit strain in sodium-ion batteries. For more details, visit my [research](research) page. In my free time, I like to head to the woods and mountains for hiking and camping!
