Welcome to my website! I am Xiaoxuan, a postdoctoral research fellow in [the Computational Physics Group](http://www.umich.edu/~compphys/index.html) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford University in January 2018. My research interest lies in developing novel physics-based models and scientific machine learning methods to address generalized computational challenges arising from the digital twin technology and specific computational challenges from applications such as rechargeable batteries, additive manufacturing, and biological materials. For more details, visit my [research](research) page. In my free time, I like hiking and camping!
