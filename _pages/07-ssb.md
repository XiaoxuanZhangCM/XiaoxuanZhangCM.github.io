Solid-state batteries (SSBs) with lithium metal anodes have the potential to achieve high specific energy and high energy density with long cycle-life, high energy efficiency, wide operating temperature range, desired safety, etc. To realize these features, many challenges from materials, processing, and architecture design need to be overcome. In this work, we aim to develop a particle-based multiphysics SSB simulation framework to improve our fundamental understanding of the coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry, and thus advance the technology of SSBs.
