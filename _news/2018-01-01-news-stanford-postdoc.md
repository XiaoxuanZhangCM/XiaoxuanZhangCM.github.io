I will work on a project titled "Designing safe and high-performing lithium-ion batteries based on a fully coupled multiphysics computational model and machine learning" in collaboration with the Bosch Research and Technology Center (RTC) North America. This project is generously funded by Bosch through the Bosch Energy Research Network (BERN) program.
